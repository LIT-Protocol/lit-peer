# This file contains a local developer's scoped logging configuration.
# The file log_levels.example.toml is ignored by git, please copy or rename it to log_levels.toml to use it.

# The general Log Levels are as follows:
# ERROR : node function(s) will not work, and client requests will fail with error
# WARN : unexpected but non-breaking issues; client request may fail gracefully
# INFO : for general, important application events,
# DEBUG :  developer-level details, but higher level ( a summary of  TRACE details ).  May be a good candidate for function level logging..
# TRACE : the most granular, detailed data, that provides context for DEBUG or INFO statements, but often won’t be comprehensible on its own.   

# See more defails in https://www.notion.so/litprotocol/Log-Level-Usage-2766f449b04180fdabfbcb72c394e4fc

# For app debugging, you can set namespace based logging to DEBUG or TRACE to get more details.

# Uncomment a namespace to set it's log level, or add a new namespace.
